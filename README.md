This project was bootstrapped with [DHIS2 Application Platform](https://github.com/dhis2/app-platform).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `.env` file Usage

To avoid having to specify the server URL everytime you start the app, you can duplicate the `.env.example` file and
rename it to `.env`. Then change the `REACT_APP_DHIS2_BASE_URL` variable to the URL of your DHIS2 instances

#### CORS issues

When running in development mode, you may encounter CORS error. To fix this issue, proxy your DHIS2 instance by
appending `--proxy http://link-to-dhis2-instance` to the start command. This will start a local proxy server
at `http://localhost:8080` (It may change ports if 8080 is busy)
. You can then point your app to `http://localhost:8080`

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner and runs all available tests found in `/src`.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/test) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
A deployable `.zip` file can be found in `build/bundle`!

See the section about [building](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/build) for more information.

### `yarn deploy`

Deploys the built app in the `build` folder to a running DHIS2 instance.<br />
This command will prompt you to enter a server URL as well as the username and password of a DHIS2 user with the App Management authority.<br/>
You must run `yarn build` before running `yarn deploy`.<br />

See the section about [deploying](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/deploy) for more information.
